# Nyazeli Records Mockup Website (Something I did to test out making an HTML/CSS/JS Website)
Here is where I experimented and tried to learn more about HTML/CSS/JS in making a mockup website for a friend's company

Here you'll see things like:
* CSS animations
* Playing around with clickable areas
* Persistent parts of the page
* Playing with the Twitter API
* Basic CSS transformations and etc.
* No scroll and making the page mobile friendly

It isn't anything official and is actually just practice which is why all the art may like unprofessional, and may also never work on it again but it was fun!

I also drew all the art, just a little bonus fact :)
